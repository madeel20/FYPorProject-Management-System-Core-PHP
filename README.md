# FYPorProject-Management-System-Core-PHP
 I coded this project for a final year student for his FYP. It is a complete FYP Mangement System. Local user can search FYP projects through a filtered approach.This application has a Admin panel and a Student panel. Students of different universities can register on this website with appropriate information. Admin can view all the submitted applications. If admin approve the user profile then user can log in to the application. User can add FYP projects providing detailed information about it. All the projects also will be approve from the admin panel.
